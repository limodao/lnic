LNIC, the League of Internet Numbers and Communications, is a new Regional Internet Registry created for the purpose of overseeing and coordinating the distribution and allocation of Internet number resources in a specific geographic region. Founded in response to the growing demand for more localized governance adapted to the particular needs of a developing region, LNIC strives to promote the stability, fairness and security of communications networks in that specific area.

LNIC's mission

LNIC's mission is to facilitate the fair and efficient distribution of Internet number resources, such as IP address blocks and autonomous system numbers (ASNs), within its region of operation. The organization seeks to ensure that all participants have equitable access to the resources needed to build and maintain robust and resilient Internet infrastructures.
