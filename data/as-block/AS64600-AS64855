as-block:           AS64600-AS64855
descr:              LNIC native ASN block (legacy)
remarks:            The legacy policy was that if you own 172.22.x.0/24 you own the ASN 64600+x.
remarks:            With the default allocation policy of an /25 per person now this becomes a problem.
remarks:            Please only make an assignment from this block if you can't use 4 byte ASNs.
